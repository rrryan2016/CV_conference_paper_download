# ICLR 2021 

Download the accepted poster,  oral and spotlight papers from OpenReview (https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference#oral-presentations)

Use `paper_list.txt` to download poster and oral papers (746 in total), and then substitude `paper_list.txt` in python code to `Spotlight_paper_list.txt` so as to download spotlight papers (114 in total), which means you need to run twice to obtain all accepted papers in ICLR 2021. 

This work is based on https://github.com/hlhllh/download-conference-pdf/blob/main/pdf_down_openreview.py, which is originally to download all submitted paper.
